Record of work on legacy issue #319 (and #344 from Crary and smlnj issue #278)

Problem: Functor with opaque result signature is not producing abstract result structure.
  - in Elaborator/elaborate/elabmod.sml, constrStr is not called correctly because of the value
    of the "curried" argument of elabFct.

Have to get rid of obscuring FLINT constructions (internal "derived" forms) that may have originally
been introduced to support curried functor syntax.
