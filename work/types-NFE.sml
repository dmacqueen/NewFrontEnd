(* NFE edited version of ElabData/types/types.sml
   - distinguish different kinds of surface and internal type variables, particularly ETV and UTV
     type variables
   - eliminate some features that were required to support equality polymorphism
     It is assumed that real type variables (PTV, LTV, ETV) range over all ground types of kind Type
   - retain the prior approach to type constructors, both type functions and datatypes
   - NFE assumes that all tycons belong to structures (except primitives?), some special case
     support for the interactive system with "top-level" tycon declarations will be needed. Some
     internal representation support for CM may also be added.
