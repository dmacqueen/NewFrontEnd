Obviousness

Language features in a good design should be _obvious_ in the sense that an experienced
user of the language finds them "obvious" rather than "mysterious" or "difficult".

Examples of features I consider non-"obvious":
   class inheritance in OO languages
   type classes in Haskell
   monads in Haskell
   generalized data types (GDTs)

Obviousness is a subjective quality and it can vary with experience.
For instance, for inexperience learners of a functional language, recursive
functions may seem non-obvious.
