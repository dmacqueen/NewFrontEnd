Compilation - Build - Execute Models

For MsML and NFE, the goal is to equally and independently support the interactive mode (as in SML/NJ), and a _batch_ mode (similar to, or supporting, a compilation/build model like CM.

* Since the language model assumes that every _Core_ declaration occurs within a structure, some special treatment
will need to be used to support interactive compilation and execution.

* In either model, there will be a _pervasive_ environment binding symbols that can be used anywhere, without
"qualification".

A compilation interface will be defined that will be used by both an interactive REPL and by a CM.

The existing CM might be revised to use this interface to the compiler, or a revised CM could be
implemented using it.

* Linking model.
  - nontraditional "execution based" linking model based on function/functor application.
  - maintenance of static and dynamic environments during compilation/build

* System Build model.
  - real functors (as dynamic functions)
  - higher-order

* Coexistence and integration of interactive REPL and CM.



* Problems:

The existing compilation/build model used by CM is ad hoc and not well documented or understood, and the compiler bootstrapping system is excessivly complex (and fragile).

CM was designed to work with the existing system where everything was built within the REPL model.
