Plan for removing infix declaraions


1 fixed global infix partial mapping:
   maps identifiers (symbols) to precedence (int) * associativity (R or L) pair
   domain is set of all infix identifiers (symbols)
     Basis infixes + fixed supply of predefined infix symbols ($$ etc.)

2 Parser:  (ml,sml.grm)
   Where fixItems were constructed before, now the precedence parser will be invoked
   directly and immediately to complete parsing of application patterns and expressions

3 Infix predeclarations can be removed from bootstrapping code that constructs the
  pervasive static environment

4 Replace old infix declarations (and their uses) with selected new infix identifiers
  E.g. "++", "--", etc. See list in proposals/new-infixes.txt.
