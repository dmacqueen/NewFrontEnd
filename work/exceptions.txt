Exceptions: Can they be "static"?

[This document is an unfinished "stub" to be completed later.]

Currently, new "constructors" declared for type exn involve the creation of a dynamic value that
is used when pattern-matching in exception handlers. [Or is this an implementation choice specific
only to certain SML compilers, like SML/NJ.  Need to check.]

Is there a reason that exception constructors can't be assigned a static identity when they are
declared (i.e., when their declaration is elaborated)?

What is the relevant research?  Is the concept of "algebraic exceptions" relevant?
What don't I know?
