Chat with John at noon.

Worked on legacy issue (bug) 338, noticing that bug requires no semicolon between the two declarations.

* Tuesday, 2025.2.11

Worked on bug 319. Wrote up notes in bug319.txt. Working on getting rid of or moving tycpath (ElabData/types/types.sml), which, along with TKind (ElabData/basics/tkind.sml), is only used in Elaborator/modules.

Worked a bit on removing unnecessary curried functors (Ast, elabmod-fix.sml).  Will continue this.
