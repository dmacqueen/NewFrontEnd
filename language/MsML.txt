MsML: Notes on proposed language changes
DBM, 2024.11-12.

0. Introduction

Let's use "MsML" as a working name for the language we are working toward, that is, the
subject of this note, where MsML is an acronym for "MacQueen's Successor ML". Note that
here the lower-case "s" stands for "Successor", not "Standard". This language (MsML)
should be considered a derivative or dialect of "(Standard) ML 97", which is my preferred
name for Standard ML (SML or (S)ML). Section 6 lists proposed Successor ML changes and my
comments on them.

Below is my suggested list of changes, which could be interpreted as relative mainly to
current SML/NJ or, alternatively, to the SML Definition (Revised), i.e. "official" Changes
are to either the Core language (annotated by "[Core] unless annotated by "[Modules]" or
"[Modules*]". where the "[Modules*]" annotation indicates changes (from the Defintion
(Revised)) that have already been made in SML/NJ. Changes relevant to both Core and
Modules are annotated by "[Core+Modules]".

The point of these changes is not to produce a "more powerful" language, but to simplify
where possible, improve some fairly obvious weaknesses or mistakes in the language design
and add a small bit of functionality of proven utility (mainly record overlay and
signature functors).  What I am suggesting could be thought of as "micro" language
(re)design, in comparison to "macro" language design, which would fundamentally change the
character of the language.  I am not soliciting "buy in" to these changes, but would
appreciate comments, criticisms, and suggestions that might influence future revisions.

Standard ML '97 was, in my opinion, an incomplete revision based on self-imposed restrictions
and [Milner's] worries about resistance or objections from "commercial" entities such
as Mike Forman's Abstract Hardware, and, later, Joe Marx's Harlequin.

Language Design Principles

* Keep things as simple as possible (but no simpler, after Einstein)

* Keep simple things simple (Generally avoid adding complexity for the
  sake of _convenience_).

* Things that are not simple should be _obvious_, once they are properly understood. Avoid
  puzzles or mysterious notions (e.g. "inheritance").


Things that I am definitely not interested in including

* "object-oriented" features: 1st-class functions is an adequate substitute.
  
* generalized data types: Not sufficiently _obvious_.

* recursive modules: See Derek Dreyer's PhD thesis for some ensuing complications.

* type classes a la Haskell: Instead, let's get rid of our one existing type class, namely
  polymophic equality. Dreyer, et al [type classes for ML], doesn't convince me.

* higher-order polymorphism: "ML is not F_omega". Besides, this is, in part, what the module
  system (functors in particular) provides.

* 1st-class structures: Some simple form of existential type might be considered instead.

* subtyping: Makes too much of a mess in the type system. We have structure signature coercion.

* type dynamic: We seem to have been able to live without this.

* "naked" recursive types: Introduced in OCaml to support its OO language extension.


Additional things that I _might_ consider including:

* Unicode support (UTF8): This seems to be something expected of a "modern" language.

* Existential types: not sure of the utility of this beyond the existing support for
  abstract types through "sealed" structures.

* 1st-class polymorphism: This might be considered, in some restricted form that does not
  disrupt type inference. Not convinced of the utility.
  

0.1. Goals and Non-goals of this document

This document presents my personal opinions on how the (S)ML language might be changed to
improve it from my perspective. It is an exercise in _micro_ language design, and it is not
meant to change, add, or delete the major concepts that characterize a language in the ML
family (e.g. 1st class functions, strict evaluation, algebraic datatypes, modules). Most
of the changes tend to simplify the language.

I am not aiming to improve the language to make it more attractive or "acceptible" to any
class of users, existing or potential. For instance, I am not interested in making the
syntax closer to that of, say, C, Fortran, or even OCaml. I am not interested in adding
"object-oriented" features, nor features supporting "artificial intelligence" or "machine
learning".

I don't have much to say about concurrency, except that the Reppy Concurrent ML exstension
(library) seems pretty good to me, given that I have not personally used it.

In other words, basically the reader can "take it or leave it", or make their own, alternative,
proposals. But I do welcome constructive feedback.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
1. Deletions

1.1. [Core] No inference of binding points for expression-level type variables

  The existing feature of automatic inference of bindings of explicit type variables in
  expressions and value declarations is hard to describe and to implement. (I myself have
  trouble remembering how it works.)

  All variables, including type variables, should have an explicit binding construct
  in the concrete syntax. This was addressed in SML '97, but in a rather ad hoc
  way. I hope that there is a better notation for expression level type variable binders.

  [This relates to, and might concievably lead to, the introduction of some form of
  "1st-class" polymorphism, e.g. for function arguments or data constructor arguments (as
  in Haskell?).]


1.2. [Core+Modules] Drop the "open" declaration form

  The "open" declaration is an example of a language feature whose semantics is fairly
  obvious and which has obvious utility, but it enables and encourages a bad programming
  habit, i.e. the wholesale import of multiple name spaces (i.e. structures), making it
  more difficult to see at a glance where a given identifier comes from (i.e. where it is
  defined).

  Deleting open declarations prevents programmers from falling into this bad habit (a good
  thing). The usual replacement is to introduce in each structure a bunch of short
  abbreviations for external modules that are used in that structure ("imported" by that
  structure). This pattern could be codified in concrete syntax using some sort of
  "import" declaration.

  Also, deleting "open" means that it cannot be used within expressions, thus avoiding
  the implicit _declaration_ of types and structures within expreesions.


1.3. [Core] No static (type or module) declarations within expressions

  Moto: "Keep the core and module levels separate", or "no static declarations within
  dynamic expressions".

  What does it, or should it, mean to have a (statically generative) datatype declaration
  in the body of a recursive function.

  [Karl Crary (and Bob Harper?) won't like this, since definition of modules within
  expressions is a feature of his dialect of (S)ML. It also appears to be supported in
  Moscow ML. The CMU (Harper, Crary, etc.) view of the static semanatics of (S)ML seems to
  base on some fundamental "type theoretic" notion of a _module_ that seems to be
  different from my own intuitive understanding of the module system of (S)ML. Their ideas
  are described in papers such as Harper-Stone and Sterling-Harper (?). In their view,
  modules are fundamental and the Core constructs are secondary or definable.
  
  Crary talks about "old" and "new" type theoretic definitions of the semantics of (S)ML,
  but I don't yet know what he is referring to.]


1.4. [Core+Modules] Equality type variables (equality polymorphism)

  If these are removed, how would we deal with generic equality (or not)?

  See [Appel94], Section 4.


1.5. [Core] Lexically scoped infix declarations

  These were a bad idea carried over from the POP-2 tradition in Edinburgh.

  What are other options for user defined infix operators?  Haskell style infixes?

  [We dropped infix _specs_ in signatures a long time ago, as well as the export of
  such specs from structures. Horrendous interaction with the open declaration. Would
  it be a terrible thing if we did not support user-defined infix operators at all?]
  
  Here is a proposal: We drop fixity declarations and have a fixed set of predefined infix
  operators. These predefined operators would be the usual arithmetic and relational ones
  (+, *, /, <, ...). In addition, for unspecified use by "users", we could predefine a
  finite number "uncommitted" infix value symbols that could be defined by the user. I
  would suggest: ++, **, //, $, $$, &, &&, %, %%, @@, all with some default precedence and
  associativity. I don't want to encourage use of infix identifiers, so ten would seem to
  be plenty. Some of these standard infix operators might be claimed as replacements for
  alphanumeric infix operators like "mod", "div", "quot", "rem", and also for alphanumeric
  infix _keywords_ like "orelse" and "andalso", which I have never felt good about.
  Precedence and associativity should be either conventional or default.
 
  Parsing of these fixed infix identitiers could either be wired into the grammar, or we
  could have a finite, predefined, fixed, "fixity" environment that would map these infix
  identifiers to their "fixities" and that would be available during parsing. In addition,
  there would be a few (e.g. 6?) predefined symbolic symbols (e.g. ++, **, $, $$, ...) of
  lower precedence that could be defined by users. The parser would use a function
  mapping such infix symbols to their precedence. Instead of wiring the treatment of
  infix operators into the grammar, the parser could invoke a precedence parser to parse
  general application forms for patterns and expressions, at the time of parsing. So the
  use of the current "partial parsing" and "reparsing" approach could be avoided.


1.6. [Modules, Controversial?] Sharing equations in signatures

  I would like to drop sharing equations like

     sharing A.t = B.s

  in signatures, letting all required sharing be specified by

  (a) definitional type and structure specifications (internal to a signature), and
  (b) where clauses modifying signatures (external modification of an existing signature).

  Note that (a) has been available in SML/NJ since version 0.93 (released 02/2993), and
  (a) and (b) were introduced in SML '97.  Note that "where structure" clauses were
  (accidentally) omitted from the Revised Definition, but were implemented in SML/NJ
  [see point 2.5 below].

  In my experience with the SML/NJ code, this is entirely feasible, but I know of
  contrived examples where sharing equations seem to be required. The question is:
  are there natural, non-contrived examples of module code where equational
  "sharing" specs are necessary. This issue should be explored in a separate
  research note (can sharing entities always be _ordered_).

  Getting rid of sharing equations would make the "instantiation" process used in module
  elaboration much simpler. It may also be the case that _where_ clauses are easier to
  understand than sharing equations for novice users of the language.

  See note "work/sharing.txt" for futher discussion.
  

1.7. [core] The "abstype" declaration

  abstype declarations are redundant given structures with opaque signature ascription
  (Harper's "sealing").


1.8. [Core] The "while" expression form

  Redundant. Use recursion instead for iteration. Same reason we don't have a "loop"
  expression form.


1.9. [Core] Eliminate the "and" connector for nonrecursive val and type declarations,
  using it only where it makes sense, i.e. for multiple, mutually recursive fun and
  datatype declarations. If, sometime in the future, we want to consider adding recursive
  val declarations for other than functions, we could support that with a new "valrec"
  declaration keyword.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Additions
 
2.1. [Core] record combination (or "overlaying")

  Let's initially introduce a syntax form e1 ++ e2 where e1 and e2 must have record types

    r1 ++ r2 is the (environmental) overlay of the r2 label mapping on top of the r1 mapping.

  This allows for both addition of fields and functional updates of fields of a base
  record (r1).


2.2. [Modules*] Higher order functors.

  As implemented in SML/NJ since version 0.93 (1993.02?), but maybe dropping special
  syntactic support for curried functor declarations and partial application of such
  curried functors.


2.3. [Modules] Signature functors.

  Signatures that are defined relative to structure parameters (or _a_ structure parameter).
  But as pointed out by Bob Harper, this is somewhat redundant, since it is similar to
  (or related to) the method of specializing an existing signature with a structure "where" clause.


2.4. [Modules] Higher-order functor concrete and abstract syntax.

  If it seems important, proper, native, concrete and abstract syntax for curried functors
  and partial applications thereof could be added. I guess one might also introduce
  curried signature functors?  Probably better to remove the support for curried functors
  and their partial application.

  [Note: currently SML/NJ does not provide a proper abstract syntax for the module level.
   This omission should be addressed in the New Front End.]


2.5. [Modules*] "where structure" clauses modifying signatures (in addition to "where type").

  This has been available in SML/NJ for many years, i.e. since the late 1990s, but was
  unfortunately omitted in the Revised Definition (SML '97).


2.6. [Core] Adding a "variable type declaration" construct.
 
  This would allow "pre-declaration" of a variable before the definition of the variable.
  Mainly justified by its use for code self-documentation, but it would also support
  simple and efficient "polymorphic recursion".

  This was actually a feature of Burstall's NPL, an early precursor of SML, and in Hope,
  an immeditate ancestor of SML. The feature is also available (and mandatory) in Haskell.


2.7. [Core] Consider 

    "try <exp> handle <match> endt"

    syntax (for instance) for handled expressions, thus closing the scope of the handler match.

2.8 [Core+Modules] Datatypes as a special form of module.

  Currently, datatypes are "fragile" in the sense that they can be
  broken.  This happens when a later datatype declaration shadows some
  of a given datatypes data constructor names.  In that case, not all
  values having the datatype as their type can be constructed or
  destructed because of missing data constructors.

  If "d" is the name of a datatype currently in scope, then "d.k" is
  an alternate name for its data constructor k, so we can access any
  data constructor of d where ever we can access d.

  [Interaction with datatype identity declarations?]
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Other Changes

3.1. [Modules] Replacement of open and include for defining extensions of structures/signatures.

   How about _extension_ functors and signature functors that add elements to their argument
   stuctures or signatures?  But not supporting any sort of "merging" of new
   declarations/specifications with existing ones in the parameter (no overriding, no
   mutually recursive definitions involving old and new specifications).

   [Viewing that as a separate dimension of _extension_ or _refinement_ of an existing
    structure/signature.]


3.2. [Core+Modules] Correct errors in the concrete syntax.

   For example, the 2 shift/reduce ambiguities in the MLyacc grammar: (1) nested matches,
   and (2) somewhere in the module system grammar. This would involve adding closing
   keywords to those syntactic forms ending in a match ("fn", "case", "handle").
   

3.3. [Core] Consider changing record selection notation.

   Would it be possible to use (re-use, overload) the conventional "dot"
   selection notation for projecting fields of a record, as in "r.a"?
   Note that #a is not really a function (can only be instantiated at a
   particular record type). I've never felt comfortable with the SML
   notation.

   If we need a field selector function, say for mapping, we can always just
   write "(fn r: rty => r.a).

   This is a change to a Core language notation, but it will _interact_ with the Module
   syntax.  For instance, the notation "A.x.r" might refer to the "x" component of a
   structure named by the path (qualified identifier) "A.x", or it might denote the
   selection of the "r" field of a record value component "A.x".  Is this ambiguity a
   problem? It can be reliably disambiguated by "type checking" in the general sense, but
   might we need to disambiguate the notation _before_ type checking in some situations?
   One could approach this by establishing strict, enforced, rules that would distinguish
   structure and value names, e.g. by requiring structure names to be capitalized while
   value names must be uncapitalized.  We could also consider using a character other than
   period (".") for record field selection. The characters "@", "#", or "$" come to mind
   as possible alternatives, but what is the impact on the definition of "symbolic"
   identifiers?
   

3.4. [Core] (Cf. 1.1) We need to think about other possible options for binding type
   variables in expressions and value declarations (i.e., "val" and "fun" declarations).

   How about something like

      val [A] x : A list = nil ?
 
   But the ramifications of this choice are not clear to me at this point.

   [See "work/types-of-type-variables.txt"]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Other issues [some relating only to internals of the implementation].

4.1. [General] Symbols and their representation

  Symbols are kind of hashed strings with the hash number also encoding a "name space".
  This may be a bit too clever. What are the simpler alternatives?
  

4.2. [General] "Dynamic" vs "static" Exceptions

  The semantics of exceptions is rather naive and by now there might be a "better" way of
  defining exceptions. I've always thought that it would be better to have exception
  declarations be "static" in some sense, but it is not clear what this would mean.  Have
  to look into "algebraic exceptions", whatever those are. This relates to pattern
  matching over exceptions in exception handler clauses. The issue that seems to require
  "dynamic" exception constructor tags is the appearance of exception constructor
  specifications in a functor parameter signature. How else can we compile exception
  matches involving such parameter exception constructors in handlers occurring in the
  functor body?

  There is also the possibility of generalizing the "exn" type (which has been treated as
  a special form of primitive type), making it just an instance of a general construct for
  declaring "open-ended" datatypes.

  [see "work/exceptions.txt"]


4.3. [Modules] Optimized data constructor representation vs (partial) abstraction

  This is a known issue that could probably be solved by using "functor inlining", but the
  interaction with higher-order functors is not clear to me. Functor inlining would
  probably need to be _deep_ or _recursive_ inlining to deal with functor arguments (and
  results?).


4.4. [Modules] "Recursive" modules (signatures, structures, functors)

  These have been studied (notably in Dreyer's PhD Thesis), but the payoff does not seem
  to justify the added complexity involved, both static and dynamic.


4.5. Marcros [General]

  No, because of terrible interactions with the type system, type errors in particular.


4.6. [Core+Modules] Type variable notation

  I've never been fond of the 'a type variable notation. I think it would have been
  better to use initial letter case to distinguish between type constructor names and
  type variable names. We could adopt the Haskell convention, where type constructors
  are capitalized and type variables are lower case, but the opposite would be more
  consistent with SML notational history, i.e. type variables are capitalized alphanumeric
  names and type constructors start with a lower-case character ("int" vs "X"). We would
  still support the two primitive, symbolic type constructor names "->" and "*" as special
  cases.

  The Standard ML notation lead to the ''a equality type variable variant. We would not
  need this distinction if we drop equality polymorphism.


4.7. Technologies for lexical analysis and parsing.

  Should we continue to use MLlex and MLyacc, or are there better tools to replace them?

  Should we use a "manual", e.g. recursive descent, style of parser (e.g. maybe the
  smlfmt parser, appropriately modified?)?


4.8. [Core] The problem of combining clausal and curried function definitions.

  This has always felt like a "messy" bit in the language design. Is there anything new
  to explore?


4.9. [Modules] Types only structures and their signatures ("data modules"?).

  Some structures contain only type declarations. Often in this case their signatures
  are entirely redundant, so their signatures are not necessary or useful?


4.10. [Core] Records vs tuples

  Currently, tuples are just a special case of records, with successive numeric number
  labels (symbols) "1", "2", ..., "<n>" for some positive n. The null tuple is treated
  specially, and is the unique value of the type unit. Is there a case for treating tuples
  separately?  This would add a lot of new "tuple" cases throughout the elaborator, so it
  would need to be worth it. What are potential payoffs?  (e.g. get rid of "bogus"
  tuple-like records like {1=2, 3=4}, record labels simplified (alphanumeric symbols
  rather than either symbols or positive integers) (note that labels don't have
  _bindings_))


4.11. [Core+Moduels] Shadowing of variable bindings

  (S)ML is liberal respecting shadowing of variables, so things like

     val x = 3
     val x = x+1

  and

     datatype d = A | B
     datatype d = C | D

  are allowed, as are related declarations like

     local
       datatype d = A
     in
       val x = A
     end

  (This last example relates to what is called "type explicitness" in the Commentary.)
 
  Should we continue this liberal policy re shadowing?  And re "type explicitness"?

  Having a REPL seems to present a fairly strong argument for liberal shadowing, as we
  often reload (repeatedly "use") a souce file (usually after editing), which rebinds the
  variables bound when the file was last loaded.  So it seems we would at least want to
  allow shadowing (rebinding) in the REPL.  But we might have a different policy within
  a basic structure expression ("struct <decl> end").


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Futher Discussion

5.1. Are the suggested changes "backward compatible"?  No. Too limiting.

   Maintaining backward compatibility is not one of my goals.


5.2. What is the impact of the changes on the Basis and SMLNJ libraries?


5.3. What about formal definition of the modified language?

  There should be a formal definition of the modified language. This could be achieved
  in various ways:

  (a) Modifying the existing Definition (Revised), as in the Successor ML repository.
      [What about the LaTeX macros? Missing index?]

  (b) Modifying the existing TWELF formalization written by Harper and Crary.

  (c) Using a new semantic definition technology?

  What does Harper say?  Use TWELF.


5.4. What (else?) was wrong with the original (Standard) ML design and its methodology?

  See, for instance, [MacQueen94].

  Are there good ideas from OCaml or Haskell (or whatever) that should be considered for
  inclusion in the list of proposed changes?  Infix operators, for instance?


5.5. The "open" declaration and "include" specifications

  These have long been known to be problematic. The original designs should be viewed
  as initial failed attempts to provide some sort of module or signature "calculus",
  meaning constructs or operations for combining or extending previously defined
  structures and signatures.  Need some new ideas.


5.6. Curried functors.

  These were originally added as somewhat clumsy "derived forms" or syntactic sugar. Then
  the FLINT group made the scheme more complicated in their revision of module elaboration.
  Perhaps curried functors are not worth supporting (given that most of the SML implementations
  never implemented higher-order functors, since they were left out of the 1997 revision).

  Programmers who really need to define and use curried functors can do it (more
  cumbersomely) using the basic syntax (i.e. the ability to declare functors as
  components of structures).  Currying is just syntactic sugar, after all.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Successor ML proposed changes

  Here I am using

    https://smlfamily.github.io/successor-ml/OldSuccessorMLWiki/Successor_ML.html

  as the reference document for successor ML changes that have been proposed.  Note that a
  couple of the links to the descriptions of changes on this page are dead, so the history
  of proposed successor ML changes provided by the above document is not complete.

  Here are my reactions to the proposed Successor ML changes.
  Generally I would prefer not to make changes that add features and complexity.
  Keep it simple! Keep it "obvious"!

[Proposed "immediate" changes]

6.1. Line comments

  OK. Don't much care, but it might be useful and popular. Secondary concern.
  An issue is: how do line comments interact with existing, nestable, delimited comments?
  This might be a bit messy (could check how smlfmt handles this).

6.2. Escapes in strings

  OK. Don't much care. Seems like minor bullet-proofing.

6.3. Extended syntax for literals.

  OK. Don't much care. Would not affect me.

6.4. Functional record extension and row capture

  I much prefer a single record overlay "operator" (expression syntax form) as suggested
  in 3.1 above.  This captures the useful functionality in a much simper way. Originally
  suggested by Wand many years ago and studied by others (R\'emy, ...).

  I don't like the introduction of another special class of variables, namely row
  variables.
  I guess a parallel form for record type overlays might be useful, but I do not
  consider it necessary.

6.5. Functional record update

  See my comments on 6.4. above.

6.6. Record labels and fields (?)

  Don't like. Too "cute". Part of this has been considered and rejected in the past.

6.7. Disjunctive patterns

  OK. Already supported in SML/NJ for many years.

6.8. Generalized layered patterns to conjunctive patterns

  No. Added complexity with little gained. Happy with just: <variable> as <pattern>.

6.9. Match guards.

  No. Messes up the simplicity of pattern matching; complicates match compilation.

6.10. Simplifying val rec syntax

  OK, but even better, let's just get rid of val rec, etc.  (I never use it!)  Use "fun"
  only for recursive function definitions. Introduce a "valrec" keywords for other
  recursive value declarations, if we ever want to support them.

6.11. Withtype in signatures.

  Done (in SML/NJ).

6.12. Fixed scoping for manifest type specifications

  OK. Seems to fix an obvious, unintended, design bug.

6.13. Degrade abstype to derived form

  No. Just get rid of abstype.
  It has effectively been abandoned in practice [I haven't used it in decades.]

6.14. Haskell-like declaration prototypes/signatures

  The description of this feature seems to have been lost!

  If this is actually 3.7 above, I'm for it.

6.15. Option bar before first match clause

  A small concrete syntax tweak for editing convenience.
  I don't particularly like it.
  What is the general principle?

6.16. Disallow non-exhaustive patterns in polymorphic bindings

  OK. Could also just make non-exhaustive pattern matches an error, period.

6.17. More liberal type sharing

  Description of the change is missing [dead link]. 

  Don't know what this refers to.

6.18. "where" constraints for structures

  Description of the change is missing [dead link]. 

  I think this has already been implemented in SML/NJ since around 1996.

6.19. Drop "and" in "where type" constraints

  OK. Fixes a syntax design bug.
  Is this the shift/reduce conflict in the module syntax?

6.20 Derived "do" declarations

  OK. Already implemented in SML/NJ as a Successor ML extension.

  Doesn't do much, but probably would be better to consider "do e" as syntactic
  sugar for

     val () = e

  in which case we would have to use the ignore function in cases where e returns
  a non unit value.

6.21. Fixing various minor issues with the formal syntax.

  Sure. Milner and the rest of us didn't know how to properly define a syntax.
  This whole issue needs to be rethought and brought into the 21st century.

6.22. Fixing various minor issues with the formal semantics.

  Not clear that retaining the Definition's semantic formalism is the best
  course. How would an expert do this with today's knowledge and formalisms?

6.23. Quoting/anti-quoting

  OK? Need to consult with actual users of the feature about whether it does the right
  thing.

  This should also apply to the "lazy" extension, which has a rather shallow, ad hoc
  implementation.

[Proposed "short-term" changes]

6.24. Unicode support

  Would be nice.  What does it entail?

6.25. Javadoc style comments?

  Why?  No.

6.26. Improve grammar so fewer parens are required?

  How exactly?

6.29. Eliminate ref patterns? (mark as non-exhaustive?)

  Ok.

6.30. Mutable records?

  No.

6.31. Polymorphic recursion?

  Yes, as supported with with new _val declarations_.

6.32. Sharing constraints vs n-ary where type clauses?

  What? Don't understand what this was about.

6.33. Higher-order modules?

  Yes. As in SML/NJ, but probably with no "derived forms" like curried functors.

6.34. Unified compilation/build technology?

  Yes, but what does it mean?  CM 2 + simplified, rationalized build/boot process?
  This is probably out of bounds because it is orthogonal to language design.


[Proposed "medium-term" changes]

6.35. Views

  But what, how?
  This has been considered and re-considered over time. The concept does not appear to
  have a sufficiently simple or _obvious_ definition.

6.36. "(. ... .)" comments, line comments?

  Why?

6.37. Re-think syntax.

  What? Why?

6.38. Weakening the value restriction?

  Been there, done that.  Gave up.

6.39. Higher-order polymorphism and type constructors?

  Sure, if this can be done while _simplifying_ the type system.  How? 
  [Beware the slippery slope that Haskell has gone down.]

6.40. First-class polymorphism?

  Sure, if this can be done while _simplifying_ the type system.  How? 

6.41. Existential datatypes?

  Sure, if this can be done while _simplifying_ the type system.  How? 

6.42. Polymorphic records?

  What? Does this simplify the type system? Doesn't seem to.

6.43. Polymorphic variants?

  See 6.42.

6.44. Type classes ...

  No. Quite the reverse -- get rid of the sole existing "type class" of equality
  polymorphism.  Harper, Dreyer, Crary wrote a paper on this, but it wasn't convincing
  to me, as it didn't address the major problems of type classes that I see.

  May need a polemical paper criticising type classes. Possibly rather old news -- I wrote
  a very short critical note on this in the 1980s.  Possible topic of a note
  (work/type-classes.txt).

6.45. Data signatures?

  What?

6.46. GADTs?

  No. Does not simplify the type system; introduces a "non-obvious" construct..

6.47. Recursive modules?

  No. Definitely does not simplify the module system. See, e.g., Dreyer's thesis.

6.48. More expressive signature language?

  Maybe, e.g. signature functors, signature extension (replacing "include").
  But Harper has pointed out that the effect of signature functors (signatures parameterized
  w.r.t. structures) can be achieved with "fibration", or use of "where" clauses.

6.49. Proof obligations?

  This would be macro language design. Therefore out of scope. Seems to lead in the direction of
  programming+verification languages like Agda, Lean, Dafny, etc.

6.50. An sML-IL?

  What? Not part of the language. An implementation matter, thus out of scope.
  

[Proposed "long-term" changes]

6.51. An "effect system".

  Future research projects, thesis idea.  Not for now.
  Possible more "principled" approaches to mutation, exceptions.
  This enters the arena of "macro" language design.

6.52. Separate compilation [Harper, Crary, et al]

  Possibly relates to CM-build-boot redesign.  Implementation matter, out of scope.
