I am going to refer to Bob's initial response file (rh-response.txt)
as rwh1. This file is dbm-on-rwh1.txt, and contains my initial responses
to rwh1. I've done some reformatting (wrapping at column 90) for my
editing convenience.

Lines containing my (DBM) comments will start with "## ". Others could preface
their comment lines by other strings, like "$$ " for JHR?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some rwh responses, in no particular order:

A. Karl's version of smlyacc and smllex is far better than the original because it avoids
writing disembodied fragments of code that manage to be stitched together to a coherent
whole. It's very nice, and should be adopted, period.

## Sounds interesting. JHR also has a version of better lexer and parser generating
## tools in the ml-lpt. Exactly what is "far better" about Karl's versions?  Where does
## one find these?  I've always thought that some of these vary early tools like mllex
## mlyacc could be improved -- seems obvious.  I have also always been annoyed with
## MLyacc because at the end one has to apply some functors to build the parser -- this
## should not be necessary. Why the "cmtool" name? "cm" = "Carnegie-Mellon"?
## http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/cmtool/
## https://github.com/kcrary/cmtool

B. Karl's IML [KML] variant of SML has lots of interesting ideas that could/should be adopted, and
the code base may prove useful for writing a reference implementation. It compiles to
Standard ML, but uses module declarations in the core language, and hence requires Moscow
ML to compile the generated code. It would be great if SML/NJ could be linked to IML [KML] as
its backend. [what?]

## Sounds interesting. See http://istarilogic.org/iml.html for details.

C. The Sterling-Harper paper on modules provides what I now think is the definitive "core
type theory" for SML, and we should build around that as the intended internal language.

## Sounds like I should look at this. Citation? Is it in the SML History archive?

D. The name sML = successor ML is a fine working name, and we can use that for the time
being. The language needs a name. The earlier efforts on sML were squashed in an ugly
manner by Robin's intervention, no doubt goaded by others, but the ideas are still there,
by and large.

## Too early to decide. "sML" seems plausible, but I will stick with MsML as my
## working name for what I am aiming for.

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Harper's List of mistakes that could be fixed
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thare are many mistakes and poor choices that ruin the experience for many people. I can
name a few here, but I am certain that I am forgetting a whole bunch more.

1. Eliminate 'a requirement [lexical convention] for type variables. We lexically
distinguish identifiers that need no lexical distinction and lexically clash identifiers
that need distinction (constructors vs values). We can try upper case for type variables,
I would have to see how it looks. But watch out: "type t" in a signature is declaring a
type variable for use in the remainder of that signature; the "t" used here should not be
in any way at variance with other uses of type variables.

## Agree (my point 5.6)
## If we always have explicit binders introducing type variables, then they
## don't need to be lexically distinguished, but some form of lexical distinction such as
## initial capital letters would seem to be convenient. Not sure we need to introduce
## binders for the implicitly prenex-bound type variables in polymorphic types (e.g.
## K : [X,Y]. X -> Y -> X). That seems rather heavy, but if we exend the contexts where
## a polymophic type can be specified (e.g. for 


2. Eliminate piss-poor equality types and equality type variables entirely, period. If we
want a module inference mechanism, see the Chakravarty-Dreyer-Harper-Keller paper on
modular type classes. We should either do it properly, or not at all.

## Agree (my point 1.4). But I don't agree on modular type classes. No type classes for me!


3. Fix stupid shift-shift and shift-reduce conflicts in the grammar. These are due to the
no-closing indicator on cases's that could be fixed easily, perhaps case match end.
Relatedly, using "=" for the clauses of a fun declaration causes needless pain when
editing code. Make these "=>" just like any other match. Even better, do away with "fun"
entirely, or migrate it into the "fn" notation but with a name for "self" to allow
(mutual) recursion. eg, val fact = fun f 0 = 1 | f n = n * f (n-1).

## Agree. I am tentatively thinking of adding ending keywords for the three flavors of
## matches, namely "endc" (case), "endh" (handle), "endf" (fn).  Or there could be a
## single "endm" keyword for ending any match? ["esac" etc. not an option.]


4. Eliminate infix. The Haskell solution, in some form, is the best option, but do not
eliminate the ability to write infix applications!

## Partially agree (my point 1.5). I think I could live without user-defined infix operators
## entirely, and I don't think I would use the Haskell convention for infix operators.


5. Pre-specificy values that will eventually (what is the region of interest?) be
declared, so that one can write val x : X -> X and later (not too far in some sense) write
val x = fn y => y, or similar.

## Agree (my point 3.6).
## I tend to think of the type specification part as the _declaration_, with the current
## notion of value declaration (val and fun) as the _definition_ of the bound variables.

6. The "exception" declaration should be renamed "extension", a la KML for introducing a
dynamically new class in the type clsfd of classified values with dynamically generated
classifiers. See PFPL for discussion. This is the right thing to do, period. There is no
such thing as a "static exception", btw. Leroy stupidly shoved this into O'Caml to be
different, and (a) it is unsound and cannot be fixed, and (b) has been overridden by
Garrigue with a proper generative exception mechanism. Incidentally, classes of unit type,
much like constructors of unit type in the static case of a datatype, are what you're
calling "symbols". Moreover, these provide bullet-proof confidentiality and integrity
guarantees in code that uses them for security-motivated applications.

## Partially agree. The exception type, with its separate and open-ended
## declaration of exception "constructors", could be generalized as a kind of extensible
## tagged union ("open datatype"?) [This actually existed in Burstall's NPL, and was the
## default way of defining a type as I recall.]


7. Integrate modules and core language more thoroughly to allow local structure, functor,
and even signature declarations. There is no reason not to do this.

## Don't agree. I do not want to "flatten" or "unify" the Core and Module parts of the
## language (see discussion at end).  This I regard as a bit of "macro" language design.


8. Eliminate the pathetic imperative programming syntax that no one ever ever ever uses or
used for anything, period. However, the Haskell-like syntax for sequencing is rather nice,
passing along both a value and the effect generated by the sequence in turn.

## What does this refer to other than the "while" expression construct?


9. Integrate datatypes and modules properly using my "data signatures" and "data
structures" proposal. eg, one may write "signature LIST = data type A list con nil : A
list con cons : A * A list -> A list end", then write "data structure List : LIST" to get
the default implementation. No more redundancy between dec's and spec's of data types.

## Intriguing, but I would like to understand what notational alternatives are possible.
## Also not my opposition to merging Core and Module languages.


10. Integrate lazy data types in a natural way such that pattern matching is the means of
forcing evaluation of arguments to lazy constructors. Does not require "by name"
variables! Does not ruin the rest of the language! It's an isolatable notion that
could/should/would be adopted.

## My inclination would be to remove the experimental "lazy" extension of SML/NJ as a frill.
## In any case, Taha's rather superficial implementation of the extension would need
## to be redone.


11. Integrate letcc/throw, no excuses, no regrets, it's the right thing to do.

## Keeping 1st class continuations is ok with me.
## But what does this suggestion mean in detail? New concrete syntax supporting the use
## of continuations?


12. Definitely allow type definitions in signatures, where and sharing clauses modifying
signatures. Note that there is not much difference between treating where's and share's as
signature modifiers and as structure components, because two sub-structures with a
where/share modifier on their signature(s) is nothing more than a where/share as a
component of the surrounding structure.

## Sharing equations are currently a form of internal specifications occurring within the
## bodies of signatures. I claim they are largely, if not completely redundant if we have
## definitional specifications, both directly and internally, and "afterward" through
## where clauses modifying existing signatures. A mistake in the SML '97 design was not to
## support both type specifications and structure definitional specifications.
## (My points 1.6, 3.5).


13. I agree with eliminating "val rec", let alone "val rec rec rec x = exp and rec y =
exp'", etc The real issue is that values are not recursive, only functions and lazy data
structures such as streams are recursive. rec is not a modifier of val. Rather the syntax
for functions introduces recursion as necessary, similarly for co-data-types.

## Agree (my point 7.10 from Successor ML proposal).


14. Syntax for compilation units, but whatever name they may be called. These are not
replaced by modules, and do not replace modules.

## Huge issue! Matthias and I once submitted a grant proposal on this problem. I still
## consider this an open research problem. Probably should be considered "macro" design.


15. Dropping open makes good sense to me. I prefer structure X = BigStructureName to open
BigStructureName, and writing X.t, etc. Dropping include makes sense.

## I think we agree. Some alternative and better way of building on existing structures
## and signatures is worth thinking about, but it I see it as an open problem.


16. Families of signatures are signatures with structure components, there is no
difference, but one could support notation such as SIG (structure X = MyXModule), which is
the same as SIG with structure X = MyXModule. Done.

## I don't understand.


17. Is "sealing" after all a good idea or not? I can never make up my mind, to be honest.

## I think it is a good idea. How else to define abstract types? A special variant of
## structure/functor declaration?


18. Karl's and my Twelf formulation of SML is the way to go. Precise, verified,
maintainable.

## What is the footprint of trained "maintainers"?  May be too small?


19. Just like the "semicolon-as-separator vs semicolon-as-terminator" dispute, we can make
"vertical-bar-as-initiator" instead of "vertical-bar-as separator" and we're good. The
first vertical bar is optional, but can always be there to initiate a series of clauses.

## May be ok, but I would not have the first vertical bar be optional, since it seems the
## main motivation is to have the clauses ("equations") line up vertically for code
## editing convenience.


20. "do e" would be handy.

## Agree. But should it include the ignore functionality, or should it expand to
## "val () = e"?


21. Agreed with dumping abstype, which I advocated 40 years ago.

## Agree (my point 1.7).


22. Disjunctive patterns are essential in some circumstances, and should be supported (as now).

## Agree (my point 7.7, Successor ML proposal implemented in SML/NJ a long time ago).


23. Calculi of records are not all that important, if you ask me.

## I would find record overlay very useful and have plenty of examples in my code where
## I would use it.


24. Line comments would be helpful imo.  Also nested bracketed comments.

## OK. A convenience for those who are used to it, which is a lot of programmers.


25. There are precedence issues with parsing fun patterns and fn patternss that lead to
excessive parenthesization; these could be reconsidered.

## Not sure what you have in mind.

Further Discussion

* Flattening SML

We know that the SML language (generally speaking) can be mapped into F-omega.

So a macro design project might be to define an SML replacement language as a
sugared version of F-omega (just as ISWIM was a sugared version of lambda-calculus).

One question then would be how much type inference could we include, and how simple would
that type inference be? [Principle: One ought to be able to do ML type inference in one's
head while reading code (though this can sometimes be like playing blindfold chess).]

There was originally a point in having a module system as a separate level of language,
namely to isolate features that are mainly intended to support "programming in the large".
Experience with CM and ML Base have lead to a realization that there is more to
structuring and building very large programs (like compilers, theorem provers, etc.) than
is address in the SML module system.  So it appears that more work is needed.

But flattening or merging the Core and Module systems (like in F-ing Modules, 1 ML) is
throwing out the constructs that were intended to support large-scale programs.

There are also lots of technical problems that come up if we makes steps toward a
flattened language, like allowing modules within Core expressions. One of these problems
is dynamic initialization of a module (which was kind of taken to be a simple thing in
the original module design, but would now not be so simple.  [Beware! Initialization in
OO languages, like Java.]

[Actually, the proposals for recursive modules involve similar initialization
problems.]
